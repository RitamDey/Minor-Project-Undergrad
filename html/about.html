    <h1>About Jain Book Agency</h1>

    <p>
           
       In the beginning of 1935 late Lala Shanti Pershad Jain of Delhi opened a book-shop named JAIN BOOK AGENCY in Connaught Place, New Delhi â€“ a shop that could cater the entire need of businessmen, corporate houses and lawyers. In that time of recession and uncertainty, he bought a place in the then very remote and ignored area called Connaught Place, built and developed by the British (today one of the top ten market places in the world). It was the birth of a legend; the beginning of JAIN BOOK AGENCY!

       Today, JAIN BOOK AGENCY (JBA) publishes, market and sell books in the field of Indian law, business, economics, politics, education, companies, international trade, business directories, service laws, Indian Railways, current affairs, commercial books - to name a few - in India and abroad through our network of showrooms in Delhi & NCR, mail-order business and user-friendly website which not only has a database of over 50,000 books, but also is convenient for online shopping. You can buy books on-line through credit cards, net banking, bank demand draft, or cash-on-delivery (VPP) basis.

       Incidentally, it is the oldest and the single largest agent for Government and various institutional publications in India. The list of respectful patrons and customers includes the cream of Indian society. JBA has become an ultimate in providing service and variety in law/commercial books and business directories. The choice you get here is rarely found at one place anywhere in India. Many fake people are trying to repeat the style so beware!

       JBA is also the first authorised printer and marketeer of Indian government official PASSPORT Forms and taxation forms, and all other legal forms.

       For the last 70 years, JBA has set examples. It has become a phenomenon! So, step-in, telephone, fax or e-mail your requirements and a prompt reply is already there.
